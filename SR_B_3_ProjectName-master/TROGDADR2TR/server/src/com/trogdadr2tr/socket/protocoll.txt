Proper communication between server and client:

Client to Server:
Send a string object with a command phrase, then the corresponding update.
	String Command	|	Object to Send
	PLACE BUILDING		Point, String name
	ATTACK BUILDING		int index, double damage
	MOVE UNITS			Point, ArrayList<Integer> indexes
	ATTACK UNIT			int index, double damage
	MOVE PLAYER			Direction (enum)
	QUIT				


Server to Client:
Send a string object with a command phrase, then the corresponding update.
	String command	|	Object to Send
	BUILDINGS			ArrayList<Building>
	BUILDING			int index, Building
	UNITS				ArrayList<Unit>
	UNIT				int index, Unit
	TERRAIN				ArrayList<Terrain>
	QUIT				


Connecting:
Authenticate, store, etc.


Disconnecting:
Client should send the String "QUIT" as it disconnects, so the server knows what's up.
If the server decides to disconnect, send the signal "QUIT" to the client. 
If the client refuses to disconnect nicely, terminate its connection after a timeout.
